SpaceKLIP 2 üöÄü™ê
###############

SpaceKLIP is a data reduction pipeline for JWST high-contrast imaging. All code is currently under heavy development and typically expected features may not be available. 

Compatible test data: `here <https://stsci.box.com/s/0oteh8smujl3pup07hyut6hr4ag1i2el>`_ 

Installation
************

At this stage it is recommended that you clone the Git repository directory for installation:

::

	git clone https://github.com/kammerje/spaceKLIP_new.git

If you would like to install a specific branch:

::

	git clone https://github.com/kammerje/spaceKLIP_new.git@branch

From here, it is **highly** recommended that you create a unique Anaconda environment to hold all of the spaceKLIP dependencies:

::

	conda create -n spaceklip_new python=3
	conda activate spaceklip_new

With the Anaconda environment created, move to the cloned directory and install the dependencies and spaceKLIP itself:

::

	cd where/you/saved/the/git/repo
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	pip install -e .

NEW AS OF 1 MAY 2023: you also need to switch to the jwst branch of pyKLIP:

::

	pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/pyKLIP/pyklip.git@jwst

Finally, and very importantly, you will need to download the reference files and set the environment variables supporting the functioning of :code:`webbpsf` and :code:`webbpsf_ext`. Instructions to do this can be found at the respective package websites (`WebbPSF <https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-the-required-data-files>`_, `WebbPSF_ext <https://github.com/JarronL/webbpsf_ext>`_). Ensure that if you edit your .bashrc file, close and reopen your terminal to fully apply the changes (:code:`source ~/.bashrc` or :code:`source ~/.zshrc` may also work).

SpaceKLIP also makes use of the JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) and you will need to set the corresponding environment variables. Follow the instructions here for bash or zsh: https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/docs/cmdline_bestrefs/. Note that you do not have to install AstroConda, just set the environment variables (making sure that the CRDS path you set actually exists, i.e., you may need to create the directory).

- the old ``JWST.py`` is now implemented here
- save individual rolls with ``save_rolls = True`` keyword

::

	contrast.py

- ``raw_contrast``: working with ``pyklippipeline``, but does not normalize flux to host star, not working with ``coron3pipeline`` since PSF center not being tracked
- need to add throughput map to database and take it into account for raw contrast
- need to add host star model
- need to add calibrated contrast
